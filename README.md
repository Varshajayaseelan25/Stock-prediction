Stock Prediction using Machine learning

Importing Libraries
Python libraries make it very easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks with a single line of code.


Importing Dataset
The dataset we will use here to perform the analysis and build a predictive model is Tesla Stock Price data.
You can download the CSV file from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timoboz/tesla-stock-data-from-2010-to-2020 

While performing the EDA of the Tesla Stock Price data we will analyze how prices of the stock have moved over the period of time and how the end of the quarters affects the prices of the stock.

Feature Engineering helps to derive some valuable features from the existing ones. These extra features sometimes help in increasing the performance of the model significantly and certainly help to gain deeper insights into the data.

(Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, XGBClassifier), and then based on their performance on the training and validation data we will choose which ML model is serving.

CONCLUSION
accuracy achieved by the  ML model is  with a probability of 50%.
